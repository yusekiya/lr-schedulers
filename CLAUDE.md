# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

lr-schedulers is a Rust library that provides learning rate schedulers for training machine learning models. It is a pure Rust implementation with no external runtime dependencies.

## Basic Principles for Project Information Management

- Descriptions should be written in a human-readable format
- Project information should be divided into appropriate granularities and documented as development documents within the `docs/` directory
- Development documents should be created in Markdown format
- This CLAUDE.md file should contain only minimal descriptions and import development documents using the `@path/to/import` syntax
- Development documents should be updated when new implementations or important decisions are made
