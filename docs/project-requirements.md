# Project Requirements

**Document Contents:** Essential requirements that the project must meet

**Document Purpose:** To clarify the project's objectives

## Essential Requirements

- Implementation in Rust
- Provide machine learning rate schedulers that can be used from other Rust libraries
- Pure Rust implementation with no external runtime dependencies (uses only the standard library)
- All schedulers have similar functionality to PyTorch implementations
- Safe and efficient API design
- All schedulers implement a common `Scheduler` trait
- Guarantee numerical calculation accuracy (using `approx` crate in tests)
- Provide documentation and sample code
